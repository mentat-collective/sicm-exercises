## Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics

Welcome to my solution and notes repository for Sussman and Wisdom's [The
Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics](https://amzn.to/2LUx62M).
You can get a copy of the book on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2LUx62M), or follow
along using this beautiful [HTML version](https://tgvaughan.github.io/sicm/).

I'm working through the exercises for each chapter using [MIT
Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/), and the `scmutils` library
(also called `mechanics` by the authors and me) that Sussman and Wisdom
developed for the textbook.

Each chapter gets its own folder, named `ch1`, `ch2`, etc. Inside each folder
I've included a file for each exercise that required code or benefited from
exploration in Scheme.

I've also worked hard to make sure that it's easy for *you* to run any of this
code, and recreate my work in any of the exercises. I've provided a working copy
of the `mechanics` library in this repository in `bin/mechanics`. There's a
small amount of work you'll have to do to make the script run, but I've covered
that below under ["Running the Code"](#running-the-code).

If you like this sort of thing, you might also consider subscribing to ["The
Road to Reality"](https://roadtoreality.substack.com/), a newsletter where I
post primers and lessons on interesting topics in math, physics, machine
learning or artificial intelligence, with a heavy emphasis on locking down the
intuition behind the ideas over mere symbol shuffling.

## Running Mechanics

You can interact with any of the utilities or solutions I've written using the
`bin/mechanics` program in this repository. `bin/mechanics` holds a full,
working installation of `mechanics` and MIT Scheme, packaged up inside of a
Docker container. To make this work, you'll need, at minimum, a working
installation of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

If you want to see graphics (which of course you do!), you'll need an X11 window
system installed. For LaTeX rendering, you'll need the `xdvi` program, which
comes with installations of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

### OS X Prerequisites

If you're on a Mac, install [Docker Desktop for
Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/) by
clicking the "Get Docker" button on the right side of that page.

[XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) will cover the X11 requirement. Download the
file [here](https://www.xquartz.org/) and install it in the usual way.

Finally, install [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) and
afterward make sure that typing `xdvi` at the terminal makes something happen.

Once you have XQuartz and MacTeX installed, you'll need to configure it to let
`bin/mechanics` make graphics on your computer from inside the Docker container
where it runs. To set this up,

- launch XQuartz from `/Applications/Utilities/Xquartz`,
- go into the Preferences menu and navigate to the Security tab
- make sure that both "Authenticate Connections" and "Allow connections from
  network clients" is checked

### Linux Prerequisites

[This page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) has a nice guide on
how to get Docker installed on Linux. I think the X11 requirement might just
work? If you try this, please let me know, or send a PR updating this README.

The [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) main page describes how
to get LaTeX on Linux. They recommend installing the [TeX
Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) distribution.

### Starting a REPL

Once you have Docker installed, clone this repository onto your machine,
navigate into the folder and run `bin/mechanics`:

```
git clone https://github.com/sritchie/sicm.git && cd sicm
bin/mechanics
```

The first time you run this it should take a while, as you'll have to download
all of the Docker image requirements. Eventually you'll see an MIT Scheme REPL
with the whole `mechanics` library loaded:

```
127.0.0.1 being added to access control list
MIT/GNU Scheme running under GNU/Linux
Type `^C' (control-C) followed by `H' to obtain information about interrupts.

1 ]=>
```

Go ahead and try evaluating some Lisp, using functions from the `mechanics` library:

```scheme
1 ]=> (square (up 'x 'y 'z))
#|
(+ (expt x 2) (expt y 2) (expt z 2))
|#
```

You're all set!

### Testing Graphics via X11

If you set up XQuartz / X11, you should be able to get LaTeX expressions printing.

To test this out, run the `bin/mechanics` script and try entering an expression
like `(show-expression (+ 'alpha 't))` at the REPL.

```
$ bin/mechanics
127.0.0.1 being added to access control list
MIT/GNU Scheme running under GNU/Linux
Type `^C' (control-C) followed by `H' to obtain information about interrupts.

1 ]=> (show-expression (+ 'alpha 't))
(+ alpha t)
```

You should see a window pop up in XQuartz with a nicely rendered LaTeX
expression:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69635/82736715-05646500-9ce9-11ea-9227-4db5fee32eb6.png)


The REPL will hang until you close the XQuartz window, so go ahead and do that
now.

## Running the Exercises

The exercises for each chapter live in their own folder, named `ch1`, `ch2`,
etc. Inside each folder I've included a file for each exercise that required
code or benefited from exploration in Scheme.

You can run any code in these folders by starting the REPL `bin/mechanics` from
the repository root folder, and calling, for example:

```scheme
(load "ch1/ex1-29.scm")
```

This will execute all code in the file located at `ch1/ex1-29.scm`, including
all side effects and graphics that the file generated. If you see LaTeX
expressions pop up, you'll have to close each one to move to the next one.

## Emacs Integration

If you want to interact more heavily with the code, add more exercises and work
on it yourself, I suggest you switch to a proper text editor with nice support
for Scheme. I use [Emacs](https://emacsformacosx.com/), specifically
[Spacemacs](https://samritchie.io/moving-to-spacemacs-for-scala-and-python/),
these days. (Here's my [Spacemacs
configuration](https://github.com/sritchie/spacemacs.d/tree/sritchie/google), if
that phrase means anything to you.)

I won't go into a whole spiel about how to set up Emacs, but I will note a
configuration options that I've found very helpful when working on these
exercises. (If you have guides you like, let me know and I'll link them here.)

### Run Mechanics Inside Emacs

Emacs has amazing built-in support for working with Scheme. I've added a
`mechanics` function to my Emacs config:

```elisp
(defun mechanics ()
    (interactive)
    (run-scheme "mechanics"))
```

(This works because I've added the `sicm/bin` directory to my path. You'll need
to do that too, or give this command the full path to the `bin/mechanics`
program.)

When I'm in a file in the project, I can type `M-x mechanics`, and Emacs will
start up a REPL running the `mechanics` code, with X11 support and everything.
Then, when I'm working on a file, `C-c C-z` will switch to the repl.

MAKE SURE you run this from the root of the project!! Go to `README.md` or
something and run it there. All of the `load` statements in all of the code
assume your main directory is the project root, so you'll run into problems if
you don't do this.

### Mechanics and Projectile

I actually use a slightly better version of the function above. If you use the
incredible [Projectile](https://docs.projectile.mx/en/latest/) library for Emacs
project navigation (and why wouldn't you??) you can make `mechanics` start
Scheme from the project root every time.

Here's the better version:

```elisp
(defun mechanics-local ()
  (interactive)
  (run-scheme "mechanics"))

(defun mechanics ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((default-directory (or (projectile-project-root)
                               default-directory)))
    (call-interactively #'mechanics-local)))
```

This will attempt to use Projectile to launch Scheme in the root of your
project, and fall back to the current folder if you're not in a project when you
run `M-x mechanics`. Total gold!

## Other Emacs Customizations

There are a few other customizations that I've found helpful working with
MIT-Scheme and mechanics. I'll detail them here.

### Prettify Symbols / Lambdas

This block of configuration code that, in Scheme, changes "lambda" appearances
into nice, pretty greek symbols. This is called
[prettify-symbols-mode](https://emacsredux.com/blog/2014/08/25/a-peek-at-emacs-24-dot-4-prettify-symbols-mode/),
and looks great.

```elisp
;; This enables nice greek-letter lambdas whenever you type "lambda"
;; anywhere in a Scheme file.
(global-prettify-symbols-mode 1)

;; Some bonus code to get this working in other language modes:
(defun enable-pretty-lambdas ()
  "Make them beautiful!"
  (setq prettify-symbols-alist '(("lambda" . 955))))

;; I'm using Racket for a different project, so I wanted the good there too.
(add-hook 'racket-mode-hook 'enable-pretty-lambdas)
(add-hook 'racket-repl-mode-hook 'enable-pretty-lambdas)
```

### Smartparens

I use [smartparens](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens) to make sure that my
parentheses never get out of balance. This is absolutely essential when working
with Lisp.

I'm used to the
[Paredit](http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html)
keybindings from years back, so I run this setting to make sure that all of the
chords burned into my fingers don't have to change:

```elisp
(sp-use-paredit-bindings)
```

To learn how to use these bindings, and what this library can do for you, check
out Dan Midwood's amazing [Animated Guide to
Paredit](http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html).

Here's a [guide comparing Paredit and
Smartparens](https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens/wiki/Paredit-and-smartparens),
so you don't get caught out by the differences.


## Native SCMUtils Installation on OS X

This method of installation is a little more involved, but if you decide that
you want to skip the Docker route and install `mechanics` and MIT Scheme
natively on OS X, these are the steps.

The instructions are
[here](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/installation.html), but
let's get through them more carefully.

- Install MIT Scheme: https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/
- Rename the ``MIT-Scheme` application in the Applications folder to
 `MIT-Scheme`, so we don't have to worry about escaping spaces in the terminal.
- Create a `~/bin` folder and get it on your `$PATH`.

Run the following command to make the `mit-scheme` binary available:

```bash
ln -s /Applications/MIT-Scheme.app/Contents/Resources/mit-scheme ~/bin/mit-scheme
```

Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`, so that Scheme can see its libraries:

```bash
export MITSCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/MIT-Scheme.app/Contents/Resources
```

Test that this all worked by running `mit-scheme` at a fresh terminal. You should see the following:

```
$ mit-scheme
MIT/GNU Scheme running under OS X
Type `^C' (control-C) followed by `H' to obtain information about interrupts.

  Release 10.1.10 || Microcode 15.3 || Runtime 15.7 || SF 4.41 || LIAR/x86-64 4.118

1 ]=>
```

Once that's working, it's time to install the SCMUtils / Mechanics library.

### Manual SCMUtils Installation

The download link for the library lives at the [SICM course
website](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/installation.html), at
step 4. Here's the [direct download
link](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6946/scmutils-20190830.tar.gz)
if you prefer that.

The next few steps come from the instructions at the course site:

- Expand this gzipped tar archive by executing `tar xzf
  scmutils-20190830.tar.gz`. This will make a directory named
  `scmutils-20190830`.
- Run `cd scmutils-20190830 && ./install.sh` to install `scmutils` into your
  local Scheme installation's resource directory.
- Copy the starter script into `~/bin` by running `cp mechanics.sh ~/bin/mechanics`.

Test it all out by running `mechanics`. You should see the following:

```
$ mechanics
MIT/GNU Scheme running under OS X
Type `^C' (control-C) followed by `H' to obtain information about interrupts.

You're all set now, and can refer back to previous sections for instructions on
how to install X11 and LaTeX, work with the exercises, or configure Emacs.
